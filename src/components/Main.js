                Hey, I am Teddy Mbugua but you can call me TBM5K. I am a self-learning software engineer who is 
                also venturing into photography and cinematography. Currently, I am working on building my website 
                which is built in React JS. I quickly set this website up but with time you will see 
                changes in this website. I am planning to showcase my coding work here and on top of that, 
                I also want to display my photos and videos. Thanks for your time<br/>ðŸ˜‰
                </p>
